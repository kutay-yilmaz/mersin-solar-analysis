# Mersin Solar Data Analysis

Simple data analysis script using **Python** and **Pandas**.

I created this to analyze sample weather data (CSV) for Mersin and calculate efficiency losses in Solar PV systems due to high temperatures.

## Dependencies
You need the `pandas` library to run this script.
```bash
pip install pandas
```

## How It Works
Reads Data: Loads weather_data.csv containing temperature and sun hours.

Calculates Stats: Computes average temperature and total sun duration.

Detects Efficiency Loss: Identifies days where temperature exceeds the threshold.

Output Preview
Running the script produces the following analysis:
