# Mersin Solar & Energy Optimization Analysis

This repository focuses on solar energy calculations and industrial energy cost optimization using Python.

## My Projects

### 1. Solar Data Analysis (mersin_solar_analysis.py)
Simple data analysis script using Python and Pandas.
- Analyzes weather data for Mersin/Turkey.
- Calculates efficiency losses in Solar PV systems due to high temperatures.

### 2. Industrial Energy Optimizer (energy_cost_optimizer.py)
A Peak Shaving and Cost Reduction algorithm for industrial facilities.
- Uses battery storage to shift loads from expensive hours to cheap hours.
- Helps to reduce electricity bills based on dynamic pricing.

## How to Run
You need the pandas and matplotlib libraries:
`pip install pandas matplotlib`
